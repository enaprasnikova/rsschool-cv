# About me
One of my main values is freedom and
growth. Therefore, I decided to develop in the IT field,  
which makes it possible to work from anywhere in the world and constantly learn something new.

My choice was the profession of a frontend developer,as I like to interact with the client side of a web application
and see the result of my work.  
My goal is to find a dream job and become a specialist in this field.
I consider organization and the ability to learn to be my strengths,  
which will help me achieve what I want.
